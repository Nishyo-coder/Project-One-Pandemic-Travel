# Pandemic Travel Dashboard

## Application to generate a COVID-19 health/safety dashboard displaying current country data statistics as well as the top news headline (from he New York Times) for that country.

Our motivation for this project was to create a web application that used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UIToolkit (CSS framework) and 2 APIs to create a dynamic and informative healthy/safety/news dashboard that provides a good user experience. 

We built this project, in part, to showcase our understanding of HTML, JavaScript, using a different CSS framework, third-party APIs and deeper use of GitHub.

This application solves the problem of "fetching" dynamic data from more than one API and constructive collaboration using the GitHub VCS.

In this project, we learned a lot -- more specifically -- about APIs, the UIToolkit CSS framework, JavaScript and GitHub, as well and selecting specific data points from the APIs to "inject" them into the HTML for a dynamic and seamless user experience.
